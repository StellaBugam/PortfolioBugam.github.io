            <h3>Data Analyst!</h3>
            <p>
                I am a data analyst with over 1 years of experience in analyzing and interpreting large datasets to uncover insights and improve business performance.
                I have worked in the health and automotive industry and my expertise lies in statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning. I am skilled in Tools and languages such as Power BI, Query, DAX, Excel, Python, R, and SQL.
                I am passionate about using data to drive decision-making from the first ideas around what you want to measure and how to capture data accurately, through data preparation, analysis and management, all the way to impactful presentation of insights and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

                <h3>Data collection</h3>
                <p>
                    As the lead data analyst, the first step involves gathering and connecting to diverse data sources. I primarily use Power Query in Power BI to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from tools like Excel (as a database) and MongoDB. Power Query enables me to clean and shape raw data by merging tables, filtering unnecessary rows, and creating calculated columns directly within the Power BI environment. This process ensures that the data is well-structured, accurate, and ready for analysis. My ability to seamlessly integrate multiple data sources allows me to build a solid foundation for deeper insights.

                <h3>Data Processing</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the data is collected, I focus on transforming it into an analysis-ready format. Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI, I create measures and calculated columns that enable advanced calculations such as aggregations, trends, and comparisons. DAX allows me to derive meaningful insights by defining custom formulas that go beyond basic analysis. This stage ensures that the data model is robust, relationships between tables are properly defined, and all necessary transformations are complete for effective visualization.

                <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                    The final step of my workflow is crafting interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to communicate insights effectively. By leveraging Power BI's extensive visualization capabilities such as bar charts, line graphs, slicers, and drill-through features I create intuitive reports tailored to the audience's needs. These dashboards allow stakeholders to explore key metrics dynamically while maintaining clarity through consistent formatting and storytelling techniques. My visualizations are designed not only to present data but also to guide decision-makers toward actionable insights by highlighting trends, patterns, and anomalies in a visually engaging way.

                <h3>Testing und validation </h3>
                <p>
                    I have a diversified expertise in the planning and implementation of testing and validation processes aimed at ensuring that products or systems fully meet the needs and requirements of patients or clients. This approach involves conducting rigorous functional tests, meticulous evaluations, and thorough verifications to ensure compliance with established standards of performance, safety, and quality, thereby ensuring a high level of stakeholder satisfaction.

                    <p>
                        The ADAS Performance Dashboard has played a key role in providing actionable insights into the effectiveness of advanced driver assistance systems across multiple vehicle models and test campaigns. Widely used by engineering teams and project managers, the dashboard enables rapid identification of trends in emergency braking, lane keeping, and adaptive cruise control performance. Notable outcomes include:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved detection and resolution of system anomalies during testing phases</li>
                        <li>Enhanced collaboration between test engineers and software developers</li>
                        <li>Accelerated validation cycles for new ADAS features</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Through this project, I learned the value of clear data visualization for communicating technical results to diverse stakeholders.

                        This dashboard compares key performance indicators (KPIs) and result distributions across different software versions tested on braking systems. It highlights performance trends and discrepancies, enabling teams to quickly identify improvements or regressions. Interactive visuals make complex data accessible, supporting informed decisions and continuous software validation. This project enhanced my skills in creating clear, actionable dashboards for automotive testing.

                    <p>
                        I developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI focused on real estate sales performance by region. Using a SQL database as the data source, I implemented a set of key indicators such as sales by geographic area, average price per square meter, offer-to-size ratio by sales type, and factors influencing the purchase price. The main goal was to transform a complex dataset into clear and actionable insights through an intuitive visual interface. This project allowed me to apply my skills in business intelligence, data analysis, and analytical design.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I developed an automated testing framework using PyTest to ensure the reliability and consistency of data extracted from measurement files. The system compares actual results with expected outcomes and generates clear HTML reports, making it easier to detect discrepancies. This project strengthened my skills in test automation, data validation, and quality assurance for data-centric applications.
